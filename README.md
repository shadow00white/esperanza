# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- How do I upload a cloned git repository?
To quickly add your project to an existing GitHub repo, just follow these steps:
Create a new GitHub repo that contains a README file.
Use Git to clone the GitHub repo locally.
Copy your project files into the folder created by the clone.
Perform a git add . and a git commit.
Push your changes up to GitHub.
